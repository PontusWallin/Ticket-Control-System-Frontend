# Ticket Control System

This the frontend application for my NestJS Ticket Control system. You can find the backend here - https://github.com/PontusWallin/Ticket-Control-System-Backend



## How to run the application.

First you need to run the backend application. Go to its repository to clone it and run it on your local machine. Without the backend running the frontend can't do much. 

Next - Open your console and run the command 'npm start' or `ng serve`. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` with any modern browser.
